## How to run code
If collecting data, make sure to run mointor_mode.sh inorder to configure the Pi to recieve packets from the correct transmitting Pi
Then run the data collection scripts and then run the respective analysis and exit each graph until the final processed data graph appears

If you are just running the analysis. You can just sudo python3 scrip_name.py and the correct CVS files for each day will be read
